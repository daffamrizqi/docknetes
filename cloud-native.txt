Cloud Native:
- It's a new way to think of building complex systems
- Takes full advantage of modern software development practices, tech, and cloud infrastructure
- Widely popular in the open-source communities

Speed and Agility:
- Among many things, cloud native is about speed and Agility
- Users want...
    - Instaneous responsiveness
    - Up-to-the-minute features
    - No Downtime
- The business wants...
    - Accelerated inovation
    - Rapid releases of features to meet disruption from competitors
    - Increased confidence - stability/performance

Cloud Native Trail Map:
1. Containerization:
    - Overtime, you should aspire towards splitting suitable application and writing future
      functionality as Microservices
2. CI/CD:
    - Setup Continous integration/continous delivery so that changes to your source code automatically
      result in a new container being built, tested, and deployed to staging and eventually perhaps to 
      production
    - Setup automated rollouts, roll backs and Testing
3. Orchestration & application Definition
    - Kubernetes is the market-leading orchestration solution
    - Orchestration :
        - Atuomation of complex, multi-tiered application deployements, scaling, and management
        - Because kubernetes provides a platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of
          a CONTAINERIZED applications
        - This allow for efficient and reliable management of large-scale, multi-tiered applications,
          by providing features such as self-healing, horizontal scaling, and rolling updates, among others
4. Observability & Analysis:
    - Pick solution for monitoring, logging and tracing
5. Service Proxy, Discovery, and Mesh
    - To provide more functionality in your cluster
6. Networking, Policy, and Security
