Container are ephemerous and stateles:
- You usually don't store data in containers
- Non-persistent data:
  - Locally on writable layer
  - It's the default, just write to the filesystem
  - When containers are destroyed, the data will be gone as well
- Persistent data:
  - Stored outside the container in a volume
  - A volume is mapped to a logical folder


VOLUMES

About volumes:
- Docker volumes are way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers
- Normally, when you create a docker container, the data and files that are generated inside the 
  container are stored in a temporary file system. If the container is deleted or recreated, this data is lost
- With docker volumes, you can store this data outside of the container's file system, on the host file system.
- This means that even if the container is deleted or recreated, the data stored in the volume remains intact
- In other words, volumes allow you to share data between the host and the container and preserve this data even if
  the container is deleted

Volumes cheat sheet:
- Docker create volume [volumeName] == Creates new volume
- docker volume ls == lists the Volumes
- docker volume inspect [volumeName] == displays the volume info
- docker volume rm [volumeName] == deletes a volume
- docker volume prune == Deletes all volumes not mounted
